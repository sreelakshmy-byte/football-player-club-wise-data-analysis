project overview:This project provides a comprehensive analysis of basketball players, offering insights into team compositions, player roles, age distributions, and salary structures, supported by various visualizations to present the findings effectively.
Preprocessing Steps Random Height Assignment : Heights in the Height column were replaced with random numbers between 150 and 180 cm. This step is for testing purposes and ensures reproducibility by setting a random seed.
Predominant Age Group Insight:The age group of 20 to 30 years has the highest number of employees, with around 320 individuals, indicating that the majority of employees are relatively young. There is a noticeable decline in the number of employees as age increases, with fewer employees in the 30 to 40 age group and very few in the 40 to 50 age group.
Highest Salary Expenditure Insight:Teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Clippers, and Golden State Warriors invest heavily in their players, reflecting a competitive approach to securing top talent to potentially improve team performance. The Center position is the highest-paid, suggesting that teams place significant importance on having a strong presence in key areas of defense and rebounding. Point Guards and Power Forwards also see high salary expenditure.Highlight teams with high concentrations of high-salary players. Identify positions with the highest average salaries, such as Center, Point Guard, and Power Forward. Graphical Representations
Correlation Between Age and Salary:The scatter plot visualizing the correlation between age and salary can provide insights into how player salaries might change with age across different teams. This helps to understand whether older players tend to be paid more due to experience or if younger players are receiving higher salaries due to their potential.
Distribution of Employees: Bar charts or pie charts represent the distribution of employees across teams and positions. Salary Distributions: Box plots or histograms show the salary ranges for different teams and positions.
